Technology has always fascinated me, and people intrigue me even more. The interplay between the two, how technology shapes lives, is super captivating! With a knack for unraveling complexity and a gift for communicating ideas and visions, I've not only secured funding in the millions for dozens of R&D projects but also wrangled the whirlwind of a tech start-up's operations.
