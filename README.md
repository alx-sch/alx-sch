## About Me

Hi, I am Alex! 👋     
I am a Software Engineer studying at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/), with a background in biochemistry and tech consulting & operations.


I build robust, efficient software and enjoy exploring systems deeply, translating complex problems into clean, maintainable code. I research, document, and share insights to make projects accessible and scalable. My background in science and consulting gives me a rigorous approach to analytical problem-solving and a proven ability to communicate complex systems to any stakeholder.

**Key skills:** Software development, problem-solving, research, analytical thinking, documentation, code maintainability, knowledge sharing, cross-functional collaboration.

#### 🚀 Featured Projects

Project Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Fractal-ISPC](https://github.com/alx-sch/NewtonFractal-ISPC)** | Parallelized Newton fractal visualizer using ISPC and C++ for high-performance graphics. This project tackles  the challenges of low-level optimization and parallel computing to achieve high-performance results. |
| **[nostr-nomad](https://github.com/alx-sch/nostr-nomad)** | Python tool for migrating Substack content to the decentralized Nostr network with automated image rehosting. Here, I directly address the complex issues of data ownership and platform independence. |
| **[minishell](https://github.com/alx-sch/minishell)** | Custom shell built in C, implementing Bash-like command execution, pipes and I/O redirection. This showcases an understanding of core OS principles and the ability to build a fundamental developer tool from scratch. |
| **[Inception](https://github.com/alx-sch/inception)** | Docker Compose orchestration of WordPress, MariaDB, and NGINX in a multi-container setup using custom-made images. This project highlights practical experience in architecting, containerizing and managing complex, multi-service development environments. | 
| **[IRC Server](https://github.com/alx-sch/IRC_server)** | C++ Internet Relay Chat server supporting multiple clients via non-blocking I/O. This demonstrates my ability to navigate and build complex systems based on precise technical specifications (RFC 1459). |
| **[STRIKE A POSE!](https://github.com/alx-sch/STRIKE_A_POSE)** | Real-time pose detection game using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, featuring live body-tracking and interactive gameplay. Here, I integrate complex, real-time data-processing libraries into a complete, interactive application. |
