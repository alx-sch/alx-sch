## About Me

Scientist turned funding consultant turned start-up enthusiast with a passion for data! 👨‍🔬 💰 🚀 📊

Tech has always fascinated me, and people intrigue me even more. The interplay between the two, how technology shapes lives, is genuinely captivating. With a knack for unraveling complexity and a gift for communicating ideas and visions, I've not only secured funding for countless R&D projects but also wrangled the whirlwind of a tech start-up's operations.

Recently, I've embraced the data bug that's been buzzing around since my study days and tagging along in all my roles. I've finally caught up with this long-time fascination of deciphering data, delving into their patterns to drive innovative solutions. I love telling stories through my analysis and making insights accessible to everyone!

👨‍💻 Recently completed a Data Science Bootcamp. 
🌟 Currently expanding my skills at [42](https://42berlin.de/) on the path to becoming a Data Scientist and exploring Berlin's tech scene.
