## About Me

Hi, I am Alex! ðŸ‘‹     
I am a Software Developer studying at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/), with a background in biochemistry and tech consulting & operations.

I build robust and efficient software, translating complex problems into elegant, functional code. My background in science and consulting provides a unique foundation, giving me both a rigorous approach to analytical problem-solving and a proven ability to communicate complex systems to any stakeholder.
