## About Me

Hi, I am Alex! 👋     
I am a Software Engineer studying at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/), with a background in biochemistry and tech consulting & operations.


I build robust, efficient software and enjoy exploring systems deeply, translating complex problems into clean, maintainable code. I research, document, and share insights to make projects accessible and scalable. My background in science and consulting gives me a rigorous approach to analytical problem-solving and a proven ability to communicate complex systems to any stakeholder.

**Key skills:** Software development, problem-solving, research, analytical thinking, documentation, code maintainability, knowledge sharing, cross-functional collaboration.
