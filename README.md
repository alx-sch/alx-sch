## About Me

Biochemical scientist turned funding consultant turned start-up enthusiast with a passion for data and coding! 🧪 💰 🧑‍💻

Technology has always fascinated me, and people intrigue me even more. The interplay between the two, how technology shapes lives, is super captivating! With a knack for unraveling complexity and a gift for communicating ideas and visions, I've not only secured funding in the millions for dozens R&D projects but also wrangled the whirlwind of a tech start-up's operations.

I've finally embraced the coding bug that has been buzzing around since my student days, accompanying me in all my roles. Now, I've caught up with this long-time fascination of crafting digital solutions, delving into data patterns, and bringing ideas to life!
